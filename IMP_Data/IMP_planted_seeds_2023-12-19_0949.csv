They work in groups of 5 persons together to make a field for each of them. all women of a village (there are 5 villages around the site Makanga) do also 10ha of agriculture to create a common budget (piggy bank). Over a few years, after all reforestation in the region is done, the tractors will be used to plow their fields, in a cooperative form. Each village will pay then for the fuel & tractorist. Therefore, they start now a piggy bank. We will support them with chops & by learning to use green manure furtilizers and later on with a depot & a transformation center. All those things will make people will protect the forests. If we can make that the local community has a better life, they will love their forests! Meanwhile, it makes the women more economically independent, wich is a start of development to gender equity and even birthrate. In januar, we start building the medical health center in Makanga. We had the first workshop in the village for that. We decided to built the medical health center outside of the village on an axe between 3 villages, to have bigger impact.  last month, we were planting 75 ha & doing maintenance in 187ha.

Erosion control work will be necessary as sheet, rill, and gully erosion sites have been identified. Nearly no mature trees can be found in this area.

Isso propicia a germinação simultânea de plantas com comportamentos diferentes que promovem uma formação ecológica mais semelhante à vegetação original, criando uma diversidade de ambientes que atrai animais, que, por sua vez, trazem outras espécies vegetais. Com isso, há enriquecimento das florestas que serão formadas, e contribuição para o equilíbrio do ecossistema. A técnica da Muvuca de sementes reduz os custos da restauração ecológica em relação ao tradicional plantio de mudas, já que utiliza o maquinário agrícola das próprias fazendas para recuperar grandes extensões de terra com espécies nativas em pouco tempo.","poor","Seed Dispersal / Direct Seeding","2023-04-19 19:37:11","2023-05-05 00:00:00",0,0,0,75,60,0,0,"","Lara Aranha da Costa","O plantio na Fazenda Guariba, município de Vila Rica- MT, ocorreu em dezembro de 2022, com a técnica de plantio a lanço mecanizado com o uso da calcareadeira para o lançamento das sementes. Após o lançamento, realizou-se o recobrimento das sementes com uma niveladora para que as mesmas não ficassem expostas e assim, terem o ambiente ideal para a germinação.  Nesta área  foram semeadas um total de 1.637,00 kg de sementes (60,8 kg/ha) distribuídas em 79 espécies, entre estas, nativas e adubações verdes, de acordo com a lista enviada.
No mês março realizamos uma visita na área restaurada em 2022, na Fazenda Guariba - MT. A área apresenta um bom desenvolvimento com o estabelecimento das plantas bem distribuídas. Nesses primeiros meses ocorrendo o predomínio da adubação verde (Crotalária, Feijão de porco e Abóbora) com plantas nativas germinando por baixo (Caroba, Caju, Ipê, Xixá, Jatobá entre outras espécies). Foi indicado um controle de capim em toda a área e assim que finalizar o período chuvoso, retornaremos na área para realização do monitoramento a partir das parcelas permanentes (metodologia encaminhada no relatório mensal do projeto).
