In its native range it is widespread in abandoned pastures and secondary forests. It has become a problem in Pacific regions and is particularly common in dry, coastal woodlands and in secondary forests. It grows on any soil type and will adapt to poor or degraded soils. T. heterophylla regenerates and forms pure monotypic stands. It is an extremely fast growing species and can easily outcompete native and other exotic trees. It bears leaves and branches almost to the base and casts a deep shade under which virtualy no other species can grow. Its thick litter layer may also prevent the growth of native seedlings.","Invasive"
